WARNING: Running in FORCE mode: some safety checks are disabled!

WARNING: The model you specified on the command line (GT16+FO+E) will be ignored 
         since the binary MSA file already contains a model definition.
         If you want to change the model, please re-run RAxML-NG 
         with the original PHYLIP/FASTA alignment and --redo option.
